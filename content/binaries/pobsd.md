## pobsd
pobsd is a TUI written in Rust designed to browse the [PlayOnBSD database](https://github.com/playonbsd/OpenBSD-Games-Database)

It makes use of both `pledge(2)` and `unveil(2)`.

### Installing
You can install it using `cargo` with `cargo install pobsd`.
Make sure to update to your `$PATH` to be able to use 
it (usually by adding `$HOME/.cargo/bin`).

### Browsing
The last (but not the least) function is the browse function.
It provides a nice yet simple terminal interface for browsing
and searching the database.
