## wcip (for What Can I Play)
wcip is a small utility that compares the `steamctl apps list` output to the PlayOnBSD
database, and displays the games you own that can be played on OpenBSD.

### Installation
You need to install `steamctl` (games/steamctl) and openssl (security/openssl/1.1). If you
want to use a different version of openssl, you have to edit the `.cargo/config.toml` accordingly 
until I find a more elegant solution. Otherwise, just use `cargo install wcip` and make sure
you have `$HOME/.cargo/bin` in your `$PATH`

### How to use it
First, you need to configure `steamctl`. Once it is done, it is as simple as:
```
$ wcip  
Loading steam data. Please wait.
