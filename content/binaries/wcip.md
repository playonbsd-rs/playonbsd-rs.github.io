## wcip (for What Can I Play)
wcip is a small utility that compares the `steamctl apps list` output to the PlayOnBSD
database, and displays the games you own that can be played on OpenBSD.

### Installation
You need to install `steamctl` (games/steamctl) and openssl (security/openssl/1.1).

You can install `wcip` using `cargo install wcip` with following env variables (to adapt
according to your openssl version if different from the one indicated above):
```
OPENSSL_LIB_DIR=/usr/local/lib/eopenssl11/
OPENSSL_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/local/include/eopenssl11/ 
```

Then, make sure you have `$HOME/.cargo/bin` in your `$PATH`

### How to use it
First, you need to configure `steamctl`. Once it is done, it is as simple as:
```
$ wcip  
Loading steam data. Please wait.
